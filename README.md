# CartPoleDeepReinforcementLearning
 Cart Pole solved by neural network </br>
 
 dependencies: numpy, websockets</br>
 they are also in requirements.txt</br>
 to use run python script from Python folder first, then the project in godot</br>


 by default it loads already trained weights. To change it set to_load at the beginning of Python script to False and toLearn to True</br>
 change saveFrequency to change how often the neural network saves its data</br>

you can make time go faster by setting time multiplier in column.gd
