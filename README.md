# CartPoleDeepReinforcementLearning
 Cart Pole solved by neural network
 to use run python script from Python folder first, then the project in godot

 by default it loads already trained weights. To change it set to_load at the beginning of Python script to False and toLearn to True
 change saveFrequency to change how often the neural network saves its data

 it takes around 6 hours for the model to train to a decent level

 Possible improvements:
 Physics in the game look ok, but aren't. When trying to speed the thing up multiplying delta it breaks. I think, the problem is in air resistance implementation
